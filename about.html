    <p>I am a student currently studying in DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore pursing a honours degree in Interactive Media and Game Development. 
      I had opportunities to lead teams as the producer and technical lead for my game projects which allowed me to hone my technical skills in programming languages such as C and C++ as well as soft skills like team management and problem-solving.
      
      Apart from IT, I have a passion in the AV industry which has allowed me to be well-equipped with video and audio knowledge from software like Premiere Pro to Pro Tools.
      The skills honed while pursing my degree are also applicable in the AV industry.</p>
